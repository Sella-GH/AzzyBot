## About The Project

Since my previous project "needed" a discord bot solution to comfort the opening and closing of a so called "club" - I built a discord bot to ensure the best comfort while using it.

The bot contains of the following features:
- A modular approach on the activating/disabling of features
- Help command to see all features
- Integrated updater (more or less functional)
- Resource usage of AzuraCast and AzzyBot displayed in embeds
- Checks if files were changed, AzuraCast is offline or automatic "closing" if no listeners are reported on the station
- Playlist export
- Local cache of music metadata
- Switching playlists
- Get song history of the last 14 days
- Get songs in playlist
- Currently played song
- Song requests
- Favorite songs (manually)
- Opening and closing a "club" (a station) also includes statistics for the "opening"
